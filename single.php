                            Speaking on on Joe Rogan’s latest podcast, the billionaire said the device could one day fix “anything that is wrong with the brain”.<br><br>

                            In their conversation, Musk revealed that the secretive brain stimulation link startup Neuralink, which he co-founded, is close to starting testing in actual humans.<br><br>

                            The aim is to create a full brain interface within 25 years.

                            This would mean that humans could connect to devices with just their minds.

                            Musk wants his brain implants to stop humans being outpaced by artificial intelligence.<br><br>

                            Neuralink was founded in 2016 and is working on tiny ‘threads’ that could be inserted into the human brain and help treat injuries and trauma.<br><br>

                            It’s not the first time Musk has made such claims. Back in July 2019, Musk said that he hoped to have an implant in a human patient by the end of next year.<br><br>

                            But that’s just the early ambitions Musk has in store for Neuralink. In the long term, he hopes to develop a device that could enable “symbiosis” between humans and AI.<br><br>

                            ‘We’re not testing people yet, but I think it won’t be too long,’ Musk told Rogan. ‘We may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think.’<br><br>

                            The news follows Musk announced in February tweet that the firm, which he co-founded, improved the initial design of the implant.
