                                          and low-income nations face severe crisis due to their limited technical and financial capacity. 
                                          With this in mind, the PM Imran appealed to the global community including bilateral and multilateral 
                                          development partners for their joint help to address socioeconomic challenges and debt relief for 
                                          developing and low-income countries. The ADB president apprised the minister that the bank has so 
                                          far extended grant assistance worth $2.5 million and repurposed $50 million from National Disaster 
                                          Risk Management Fund for Pakistan to respond to the corona pandemic and this support would

                                        centric agenda, therefore, the Government would continue to implement conventions and enhance its

                                        Australia have deposed India in the world Test rankings and Pakistan in the Twenty20 standings, 
                                        the International Cricket Council said Friday. Just two points separate Australia (116), New Zealand (115) and India (114), 
                                        who slipped to third position in the Test standings, with cricket across all formats suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
                                        India had held the number one spot since October 2016 [...]
                                        <!-- Virat Kohli s side stay top of the world Test championship between the top nine Test sides, 
                                        however. In 2019 India claimed their first ever Test series win in Australia after 71 years of trying, 
                                        but Australia remained unbeaten in the series that followed. The return of Steve Smith and David Warner 
                                        from ball-tampering bans also helped Australia retain the Ashes after levelling the series in England 2-2. 
                                        Australia, led by Tim Paine, then blanked Pakistan and New Zealand at home to cap off a successful season 
                                        cut short by the coronavirus outbreak. But coach Justin Langer said beating India on their own turf was their ultimate goal. "
                                        I said in my first conference as coach we will know we are a great team if we can beat India in India,"
                                         he said in a Cricket Australia press release.  "We know they are so tough to beat so only then will we really know we can claim the number one spot." 
                                         India are scheduled to tour Down Under later this year. Australia are not slated to play a series in India until 2022. 
                                         The annual update of the rankings eliminates results from the 2016-17 season when India won 12 and lost just one Test.
                                         The system also gives more weight to matches played since May 2019 than those of the previous two years. 
                                         South Africa suffered the biggest fall of eight points, which sees them drop below Sri Lanka to sixth place. 
                                         England are fourth. In the one-day rankings, world champions England consolidated their number one position, 
                                         followed by India and New Zealand. In the T20 chart Australia ended Pakistan s 27-month stay at the top to reach the summit for the first time 
                                         since rankings in the shortest format were introduced in 2011. Pakistan are now in fourth position while England jumped to second and
                                          India to the third spot. Australia are due to host the T20 World Cup in October if it is not delayed by the pandemic. -->

                                        Three "rare" Harry Potter first editions that were found in a skip 12 years ago are expected to sell for thousands at auction.

                                        Two paperback versions of Harry Potter and Philosopher's Stone and one hardback are going up for sale in May.

                                        The seller rescued them when a school was throwing tatty books away in preparation for an Ofsted inspection.

                                        Derbyshire auctioneer Hansons says hardback first editions of the book are "as rare as hens' teeth" [...]
                                        <!-- The 65-year-old owner from Buckinghamshire - a teacher who did not want to be named - said when she saw the books in the skip "it just seemed awful to throw them away".

                                        "I had no idea they were of any value, and neither did the school," she said. "They'd been well-read and the school always ensured its library was pristine for Ofsted inspections."

                                        The books ended up in her loft, but four years ago her son investigated their value.

                                        The seller said: "A London business offered £4,000 for one of the paperbacks there and then, but they just went back into the loft.

                                        "Last year we were watching a TV interview with Charles Hanson, owner of Hansons Auctioneers, about the sale of a Harry Potter first edition which sold for thousands at auction and decided to get in touch."
                                        Hansons book expert Jim Spencer said: "Hardback first editions of Philosopher's Stone are as rare as hens' teeth. They're the holy grail for collectors."

                                        There were 500 hardback first editions of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone printed in 1997.

                                        Three-hundred of the books were sent to British schools and libraries and others were sent to private book shops.

                                        All of them contain printing errors, which were corrected in later versions.

                                        The hardback is expected to sell for between £8,000 and £12,000, and the two paperbacks are expected to fetch £2,000 and £3,000 each in the Potter-themed online-only auction on 21 May at Bishton Hall in Staffordshire. -->

                                        Speaking on on Joe Rogan’s latest podcast, the billionaire said the device could one day fix “anything that is wrong with the brain”.

                                        In their conversation, Musk revealed that the secretive brain stimulation link startup Neuralink, which he co-founded, is close to starting testing in actual humans.

                                        The aim is to create a full brain interface within 25 years.

                                        This would mean that humans could connect to devices with just their minds.

                                        Musk wants his brain implants to stop humans being outpaced by artificial intelligence [...]

                                        <!-- Neuralink was founded in 2016 and is working on tiny ‘threads’ that could be inserted into the human brain and help treat injuries and trauma.

                                        It’s not the first time Musk has made such claims. Back in July 2019, Musk said that he hoped to have an implant in a human patient by the end of next year.

                                        But that’s just the early ambitions Musk has in store for Neuralink. In the long term, he hopes to develop a device that could enable “symbiosis” between humans and AI.

                                        ‘We’re not testing people yet, but I think it won’t be too long,’ Musk told Rogan. ‘We may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think.’

                                        The news follows Musk announced in February tweet that the firm, which he co-founded, improved the initial design of the implant. -->
